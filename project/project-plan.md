## Topic Name: Analyzing the Impact of Air Quality on Crop Production in Germany 
## Main Question
1.	What is the correlation between various air pollutants (e.g., CO, NO2, O3, PM10, PM2.5, SO2) and crop   production metrics (e.g., area harvested, yield, production) in Germany for the years 2016-2019?
2.	How have trends in crop production in Germany changed over the long term (1961-2019)?
3.	Are there any significant differences in the correlation between air quality and crop production when comparing recent data (2016-2019) with historical data (1961-2019)?
4.	How do different crops respond to variations in air quality indicators over time?
   
## Summary
This project will explore a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between air quality and crop production in Germany by leveraging both recent (2016-2019) and historical (1961-2019) data. The project investigates how various air pollutants impact agricultural productivity. The project will involve merging and analyzing these datasets to identify correlations, trends, and patterns over different time periods. By comparing recent data with long-term historical trends, the project seeks to provide insights into the effects of environmental factors on crop yields and inform future agricultural and environmental policies.

## Goal

### Primarily  
1.  Understand the impact of air quality on crop production in Germany
### Specifically 
1.	Identify correlations between air pollutants and crop production metrics for recent years (2016-2019).
2.	Analyze long-term trends in crop production using historical data (1961-2019).
3.	Compare recent and historical trends to identify any significant changes or patterns over time.
4.	Provide actionable insights that can help policymakers and stakeholders make informed decisions regarding agricultural practices and air quality management.
5.	Contribute valuable knowledge to the fields of environmental science and agriculture, highlighting the importance of maintaining good air quality for sustainable agricultural productivity.
